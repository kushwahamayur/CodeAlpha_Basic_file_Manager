Task:- Basic File Manager

This C++ program provides basic file management functionality through a command-line interface. It supports:

1. Listing files in a directory.
2. Creating directories.
3. Viewing files by displaying their contents.
4. Copying files to a new location.
5. Moving files by copying them and deleting the original.



Each operation checks for errors (e.g., invalid file paths, missing files) and reports the status to the user. The program is interactive and continuously prompts the user for commands until they choose to exit.
